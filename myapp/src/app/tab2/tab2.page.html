             <p>Actor Jon Hamm has revealed that the upcoming sequel of 'Top Gun' maintains the vibe of the 1986 original but takes the story in a different direction.
                Hamm, who has joined original stars Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer and Miles Teller in the much-anticipated movie, said audience will surely enjoy the film.
                
                "I can't really tease much about my role. Doing this film has been a very strange experience, but it's been a wonderful experience as well. It will have a very similar vibe to the first one. For people who loved the first movie it's going to be very interesting to watch. It very much takes the story in a different direction. But I think for the new fans it's gonna be something very cool, too," Hamm told a daily tabloid.
                The 48-year-old actor also shared that 'Top Gun: Maverick' is being shot in mind-blowing 6K definition, which will leave the audience stunned.
                "The aerial footage is mind-blowing. And it's mostly practical, there's not a lot of CGI (computer generated). Those goes are really up in planes and getting thrown around in multiple Gs. So it's very exciting to watch. They showed me 15 minutes of footage and I left the trailer with my chin on the ground. I was saying, 'Oh my God, this is so cool. It will be out of this world'," he said.
                The sequel is set 34 years after the original hit the screens and will focus on modern drone warfare and explore the end of the d</p>

He wrote, 'As happy as can be for my big brother today who’s always been a shining example of a human being for me. Not a doubt in the world that you deserve the smashing success but it continues to baffle me how you were able to play one of the most complex, lost and damaged characters with such perfection while returning home to being the most centered, loving and responsible family man I know. Thank you for showing me what it means to be a responsible son, father, husband and brother always AND for knocking me out with your performance in and as #KabirSingh</p>
